# My First Wii Game!!!
Recently, I've been into modding my video game consoles. First I modded my **3DS**, then my **DSi**, and then my **Wii!** Of course, I had fun playing the cool homebrew games, but I also wanted to make some of my own!

It has been quite a struggle... I found initial success in using a library called **WiiLÃ–VE** because it used Lua which is a programming language I'm already familiar as I have been a **Roblox** developer for 9 years. Unfortunately, I couldn't quite get Wiimote inputs to work properly.

So... I had to switch to a different library called **GRRLIB**. Something I should mention is that I'm a **Mac** user. However, GRRLIB was for **Windows** (and **Linux**, I guess). So for a while, I had to use my **Macbook** which had **UTM** (a **virtual machine** that can emulate Windows) on it. I couldn't get UTM on my iMac because it's, like, _really old_. UTM was for **ARM** CPUs and my Mid-2010 iMac had an **Intel** CPU.

Another problem was that GRRLIB used **C**, which is a programming language that I've NEVER used before. I have made games in **Unity** which uses **C#**, so I thought that they would be similar enough. And to an extent, I was right! I found that I was able to implement a lot of my knowledge from C# into C.
