recently i've been into modding my video game consoles. first was the 3ds, then the dsi, and then the wii. of course i had fun playing the cool homebrew games, but i also wanted to make some of my own!

it has been quite a struggle... i found initial success in using a library called WiiLÃ–VE because it used lua which is a programming language i'm already familiar with having been a roblox developer for 9 years. unfortunately, i couldn't quite get wii remote inputs to work properly.
