# My First Wii Game!!!
Recently, I've been into modding my video game consoles. First I modded my **3DS**, then my **DSi**, and then my **Wii!** Of course, I had fun playing the cool homebrew games, but I also wanted to make some of my own!

It has been quite a struggle... I found initial success in using a library called **WiiLÃ–VE** because it used Lua which is a programming language I'm already familiar as I have been a **Roblox** developer for 9 years. Unfortunately, I couldn't quite get Wiimote inputs to work properly.

So... I had to switch to a different library called **GRRLIB**. Something I should mention is that I'm a **Mac** user. However, GRRLIB was for **Windows** (and **Linux**, I guess). So for a while, I had to use my **Macbook** which had **UTM** (a **virtual machine** that can emulate Windows) on it. I couldn't get UTM on my iMac because it's, like, _really old_. UTM was for **ARM** CPUs and my Mid-2010 iMac had an **Intel** CPU.

Another problem was that GRRLIB used **C**, which is a programming language that I've NEVER used before. I have made games in **Unity** which uses **C#**, so I thought that they would be similar enough. And to an extent, I was right! I found that I was able to implement a lot of my knowledge from C# into C. I'm really grateful for the example builds that are provided with the GRRLIB download because I was able to learn how to do things like **rendering shapes** and **Wiimote inputs** from them! There was also some documentation that came with the download, which was also pretty helpful. I couldn't manage to render **.ttf** files for some reason, but that could be because I had to modify the **make** file, which is something I had to do quite a bit later on.

Another struggle point for me was **implementing audio**. There were some examples that came with the installation of **devkitPro**. I could build the **.mp3** one, but when I tried to implement it in my project, it didn't work for some reason, even when I edited the make file. I couldn't build the **.ogg** example because I had to install some libraries that didn't come with devkitPro (**ppc-libogg** & **ppc-libvorbisidec**) which I couldn't figure out how to do on Windows. The only audio example that I was able to implement into my project was the **.mod** example. What's .mod, you might be asking? Oh yeah, it's just a ***VERY INCOMPATIBLE MIDI AUDIO FORMAT FROM 1987.*** There are virtually *ZERO* ways to covert most widely known audio formats to .mod. The only program I found that was able to export .mod files was **OpenMPT**.

So... I wasn't very excited to face the harsh reality that I would have to make EVERY sound in an incompatible MIDI format using a program that I had no idea how to use.
